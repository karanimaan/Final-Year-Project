# Cancellation algorithms applied to recorded audio data

This project is an investigation into the effectiveness of cancellation algorithms
applied to recorded audio data.

## About
A brief summary of the project can be found in [the poster pdf](Poster.pdf). A detailed report can be found in [the project report pdf](Final year project report.pdf).

## Audio files
The audio files used in testing the algorithms can be found under `sound files`. 
Tone & white noise audio files are under `sound files/mono`. 
Music audio are under `sound files/stereo`.

## Code
The matlab script, created to cancel noise for each audio type, can be found in `Cancel_<audio type>.m`.
