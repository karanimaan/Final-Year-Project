# Cancellation algorithms applied to recorded audio data

This project is an investigation into the effectiveness of cancellation algorithms
applied to recorded audio data.

## Audio files
The audio files used in testing the algorithms can be found under `sound files`. 
Tone & white noise audio files are under `sound files/mono`. 
Music audio are under `sound files/stereo`.
