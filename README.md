# Cancellation algorithms applied to recorded audio data

This project is an investigation into the effectiveness of cancellation algorithms
applied to recorded audio data.

## About
A brief summary of the project can be found in [the poster pdf](Poster.pdf). A detailed report can be found in [the project report pdf](Final%20year%20project%20report.pdf).

## Audio files
The audio files used in testing the algorithms can be found under `sound files`. 
Tone & white noise audio files are under `sound files/mono`. 
Music audio are under `sound files/stereo`.

## Code
There are two matlab scripts, created to cancel noise for each audio type: [cancelling white noise](cancel_mono_white_noise.m) and [cancelling stereo music](cancel_stereo_music.m).
